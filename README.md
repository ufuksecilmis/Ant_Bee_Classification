We will use Pytorch Lightning.

The problem weâ€™re going to solve today is to train a model to classify ants and bees. We have about 120 training images each for ants and bees. There are 75 validation images for each class. This dataset is a very small subset of imagenet.

# Steps
1.Use torchvision to upload and transform images.

2.Create mini-batches for training.

3.Train ResNet-18 model from stratch

4.Test The Model

5.Create Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve

# Dataset

Download the data from here and extract it to the current directory.
